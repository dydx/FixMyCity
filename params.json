{"name":"Fix My City","tagline":"Main Webapp","body":"### Fix My City\r\n\r\nThis is my submission to the 2015 National Day of Civic Hacking. Fix My City aims to be a comprehensive web based service to empower citizens to inform their maintenance and utilities departments of things that need to be fixed.. in their city.\r\n\r\n![dashboard](http://i.imgur.com/TrI1s32.png)\r\n\r\nIt is still a work in progress. Currently the administrative console is about 70% complete, with a lot of work needed still on the client-facing side of the application.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the client-facing bit of Fix My City allows citizens to geotag areas of interest along with a short description of the problem at hand. That information is made immediately available to the administrative console as a grid of map locations with addresses and descriptions, color highlighted by severity.\r\n\r\nTo install Fix My City, the following requirements need to be met:\r\n\r\n* PHP 5.6+ (w/mcrypt extension)\r\n* MySQL\r\n* Composer\r\n* Node/NPM\r\n\r\nTo get the code and install it, log into your environment or server and run:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/dydx/FiMyCity`\r\n\r\nthen, move that directory into your web root or just in your local build path. Run `npm install` and `composer install --prefer-dist`, and let the required packages be downloaded.\r\n\r\nTo migrate the database and get setup, you will need to set the correct MySQL connection variables in the .env file, then run the following command in the root of the `FixMyCity` directory:\r\n\r\n`php artisan migrate`\r\n\r\nThis will set up your database tables.\r\n\r\nYou may then register a new user account and start using Fix My City.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n* A lot...","google":"UA-1060804-21","note":"Don't delete this file!
